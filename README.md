# Project: PostgreSQL and Python Integration

# Objective
* Integrate Python with PostgreSQL using the psycopg2 library.
* Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and execute SQL queries.
* Analyze Amazon Sales Data using additional KPIs.

# Step-by-Step Process
# 1. Environment Setup
* Install PostgreSQL (Open Source Relational Database System) and Python.
* Install required libraries: Pyscopg2
* Download the Amazon Order Data (Kaggle Dataset) and load it into PostgreSQL.

# 2. Database Design (ERD Diagram)
Key Component for Data Warehousing and Data Modelling.
Fact Table: Sales
Includes fields: order_id, customer_id, item_id, region, order_date, profit, etc.
Dimension Tables:
Geographic (fields: region_id, region_name).
Item (fields: item_id, item_name, category).

# 3. Python Integration with PostgreSQL
* File: amazon_sales.ipynb
* Key Steps:
# 1. Establish Connection and Cursor: It is the 1st step to interact with the Postgres SQL Database. 

# 2.Define CRUD Functions:
* Create, Insert, Update, and Delete: Define functions for data insertion, updates, and deletion with parameterized queries.

# 3.Execute Queries: KPI and Business Use case Reporting
* Find Highest Profit Region:Calculate the Region with the Highest Profit.
* Identify Delayed 'H' Priority Orders:Analyze critical delayed orders.

# Key Highlights and Learnings

* Integration Importance: Seamlessly combining Python's data manipulation capabilities with PostgreSQL's robust querying tools enables efficient data processing and analysis.
* Scalability: The use of a relational database and data warehousing principles ensures that the solution is scalable for large datasets.
* Business Value: By analyzing KPIs such as profit by region and delayed critical orders, this project provides actionable insights that can improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

# Key Learnings:
* Enhanced understanding of data modeling through ERD design.
* Practical experience in using Python for database operations with psycopg2.
* In-depth knowledge of deriving business insights through SQL queries.
